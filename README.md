# ally_AccessiCity

AccessiCity is a Web App that aims to help cities better understand their public transportation systems. In this particular ShinyApp, the General Transit Feed Specification dataset for Mexico City has been used. 

AccessiCity aims to make this dataset more accessible through software. The theme of this exercise is to enable users to easily view which transit stops support wheelchair boarding within their city. 

Therefore, users concerned with wheelchair boarding accessibility at public transportation stops will be able to: 
1. Select the public transportation mode they wish to query
2. View all the stops in the transit system in general, and have the option to only view the stops (by mode) that support wheelchair boarding
3. Click on the individual stops (points) to view the names of the stops
4. View a polygon that visualizes the extent of coverage for regular and accessible (for wheelchair boarding) public transit stops within the city
